# Docker-Security-Enviroment
This repository is to contain my work for a Technical Report (ENGR 411) for 1 credit at Concordia University during the Fall 2018 Semester

### Mandate
I am merely an aide in this endevor where my role is to provide a secure docker enviroment made for testing how currupt images may be deployed within a network since I have the physical resources to provide this service.

For the final report I will produce it should contain...
- produce an analysis of the various tools available
  - what they do
  - how they work
  - user freindly ( easy to install and use )
  - production safe
- benchmark the various tools for scanning time.

## Executive Summary
// Insert lovely table

// Benchmark times ( this will be anchore vs vuls )

### Notes
Can be found in the [blog](https://prince-chrismc.github.io/Docker-Security-Environment/blog) to describe what I've done such that I can produce a 20 page technical report on the subject at the end. There will be more technical details within the blog than the summary. As of _19/11/2018_ I have not decide wether my technical report will be publically available...
