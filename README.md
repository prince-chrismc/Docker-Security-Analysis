# Docker-Security-Enviroment
This repository is to contain my work for a Technical Report (ENGR 411) for 1 credit at Concordia University during the Fall 2018 Semester

## Mandate
I am merely an aide in this endevor where my role is to provide a secure docker enviroment made for testing how currupt images may be deployed within a network.

## Notes
Can be found in the [blog](https://prince-chrismc.github.io/Docker-Security-Environment/blog) to describe what I've done such that I can produce a 20 page technical report on the subject at the end.

## TO DOs
