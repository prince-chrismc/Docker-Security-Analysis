## Mission: 
Successfully get a timestamp for how long it takes to scan an image.

Good news is, it is possible to subscribe to analysis updates with the [subscription](https://anchore.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/36000003890-working-with-subscriptions)... Unfortunately for me this is a RESTful appliation and send webhooks ovet HTTP POST formatted as JSON.

I will most likely have to re-use my webserver to capture these and report something meaningful...

CLI:
```
anchore-cli subscription activate <SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE> <SUBSCRIPTION_KEY>
SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE: analysis_update
SUBSCRIPTION_KEY: princechrismc/ping-test
```
