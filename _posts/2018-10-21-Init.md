In order to deploy malicious malware into my network I first had to shutdown and remove all my critical, I took the oppurtunity to update and backup many of the machines ( baremetal and VMs ) since it's the first time I ever have done a tear down in the 10 months since I built my setup. Next tear down is slated for mid 2019 when I move.
