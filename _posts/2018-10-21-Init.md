#### Mission
Establish a secure infrastructure to deploy and test potential dangerous containers.

Thankfully for me I am a "homelaber" this means I have several servers sitting a 42u rack with little 48 port gigabit switch and some experience doing this kind of work. 

In order to deploy malicious malware into my network I first had to shutdown and remove all my critical application
- I took the oppurtunity to update and backup many of the machines ( baremetal and VMs ) since it's the first time I ever have done a tear down in the 10 months since I built my setup. Next tear down is slated for mid 2019 when I move.
