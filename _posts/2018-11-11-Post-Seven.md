I am trying to validate that whether altering the state of the host ( ie installing vulnerabilities ) will be caught by the security scan

for this I have selected [ffmpeg](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-1999012/) library as my test subject.

- original test image ID: ea4c82dcd15a33e3e9c4c37050def20476856a08e59526fbe533cc4e98387e39
- after force adding:     ea4c82dcd15a33e3e9c4c37050def20476856a08e59526fbe533cc4e98387e39

So i am re scanning the same image !

New scan took 2 minutes ........................ No new vulnerabilities... perhaps this one is not in my DB locally
