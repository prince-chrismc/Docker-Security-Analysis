Setup routing and iptable on `cmcarthur-router` @ 192.168.10.1 however the VM died and I lost all my settings... I had my EXSI 5.5 host on DHCP @ 192.168.10.238 able to ping the gateway and WAN router. Despite this I did run a _ubuntu:latest_ image and ran a security scan using [this tool](https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security) only runs against engine looking for vulnerabilies. This is my fave guide for [setting up docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04)
