#### Mission
- Configure router with iptable tools rules.
- Install Docker Engine

###### Routing
Setup routing and iptable on `cmcarthur-router` @ 192.168.10.1 however __SPOILER:__ Went out for supper came home found the VM died and I lost all my settings because there's to `ctrl+s` on the linux routing table... I had my EXSI 5.5 host on DHCP @ 192.168.10.238 able to ping the gateway and WAN router. When I unlogged the VM network there was no access to anything within the home network nor to the outside world.

###### Engine
This is my fave guide for [setting up docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04) used it a few times now. Works like a charm.

Despite my router issues I did run a _ubuntu:latest_ image and ran a security scan using [this tool](https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security) only runs against engine looking for vulnerabilies through bad configuration.

Comments:
- its was not very painful to set up and deploy
- the output was fairly easy to read.
- copying a warning into google produced forums with several solutions ( makes sense since it looks for the _known_ configuration vulnerabilities )
