This AM i'm trying to install and use [vuls](https://vuls.io/en/)

Following the [docket container](https://vuls.io/docs/en/tutorial-docker.html) guide

took 3hrs to fill the database... RIP my soul... go-exploitdb is marked TODO in the docs... so much for my expectation of it being good since they used Docausaurus
