title: Trying out deep-scan

#### Mission
Vuls offers several modes and up until now I've only tested against the 'fast' scan mode. Today's missing is to test the deep scan, this is supposed to find _all_ vulnerabilities.

First problem is vuls will need __root__ access to the container... this means building a container with a user that Vuls will be able to ssh into.

Secondly It requires some packages which are not present in the default ubuntu image I am starting from... Now this is incredably backwards... Here's the build for just installing ping and adding a user `vuls` to sudoers...

```shell
cmcarthur@docker-engine-one:~$ docker build ./ping-test

And now let's  install the `checkrestart` package as well

```shell
The following NEW packages will be installed:

  file groff-base iputils-ping krb5-locales libasm1 libasn1-8-heimdal libbsd0

```

Yep ... counter productive... for sure I'll find more vulnerabilities....


Turns out deep scan fails on my ping-test ubuntu image... The extra required package fails LOL !

5 more dependencies are requires... However I did see some life in the debug print ( the change log files are massive )

Deep scan does no work on host because it hangs on sudo credentials! ( ill need to modify my sudoers I forgot do correct that for my host )

Some pretty crazy results.... 

With the caching it took 32s!! [diff](https://github.com/prince-chrismc/Docker-Security-Environment/commit/9defffae7bdab9b2f8f5064e9d7e5d5edcc95739)

There were several new vulnerabilities ( and thats without updated databases of CVEs ) just the new packages.. I suspected it would be counter productive to install more tools.

It does have the added bonus of telling you which CVEs have been fixed ( I manually checked on of them and it is listed in a higher package version that the CVE was addressed )

After serval hours it seems the scan hanged on 5 packages... I will re-run the scan in debug tomorrow, I can not scan and update the databases at the same time.

Very odd... ill retry running it again... since what's missing
