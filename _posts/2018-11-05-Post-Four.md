Today's mission: Scan a modified image.

In order to do this using anchore, I worst went on the adventure of modifying and commiting a new image... for my first test I opt'ed for installing ping. from my container i was able too `ping -c 2 google.ca` following which i made my `docker commit`

Next i tried scanning the image with anchore but it could not be found with the sha. so i commited the image again with a meaningful name `ping-test`. scanning was unable to pick up the image.

With a little bit of help from the `--debug` flag i noticed it was looking on the _docker.io_ repository.

I then installed and now host my own private repository! I have pushed my ping test image as `my-tests` on the registry. deleting it locally i was able to pull it again.

currently trying to add the repository to anchore but im getting stuck with it not finding a manifest

running `curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/v2/catalog` as well as `curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/v2/my-tests/tag/latest` produces what looks like correct results.
